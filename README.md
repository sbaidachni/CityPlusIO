# CityPlusIO
In this joint development effort, Microsoft teamed up with Robust Choice Cloud Solutions to create an intelligent solution that enables two-way mass communication with citizens to support them before, during, and after disasters like earthquakes, floods, terrorist attacks, and more. 

We used several Azure services and Microsoft tools to achieve our goals. These services and tools include:
- Microsoft Bot Framework – two ways communication with users
- Azure Functions – analytics and direct line channel invocation
- Azure SQL - storage
- Azure Storage Service (Blobs and Queues) – storage for images and in progress messages 
- Azure Mobile Applications – backend for Xamarin admin application
- Power Bi Embedded – reporting system
- Azure Web Applications – reporting portal
- Cognitive Services: Text Analytics, Emotion API, Computer Vision, Face API and LUIS – to collect analytics data and recognize users input
- Bing Map service – to calculate location by address
- Xamarin Forms – to create admin application and direct line client
